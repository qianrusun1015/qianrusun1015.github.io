	<h1>Hi there, I'm Qianru!</h1>
	<p>I'm currently a Research Fellow in the NExT++ lab, National University of Singapore. 
					I am leading the computer vision group, mainly working on image recognition and data augmentation tasks. 
					Before that, I had been a post-doctor in the department of Computer Vision and Multimodal Computing, 
					Max-Planck Institute for Informatics in Germany for two years, collaborating with Prof.Dr. Bernt Schiele. 
					I hold a PhD degree from the School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, 
					Peking University, since Jan. 2016. 
					My research interests include computer vision and multimedia. 
					Specific experiences have been made in human action recognition, anomaly event detection in videos, 
					social relation recognition and head image inpainting in social media photos, person image generation 
					for both low-resolution re-identification images and high-resolution fashion photos.</p>
